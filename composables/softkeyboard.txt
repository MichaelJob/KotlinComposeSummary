There are two options to tell your app what to do if the soft keyboard shows up.
Either the layout stays as it is or the available size gets reduced and your apps
layout will adjust accordingly. Depending on the use case you have to decide which
option is needed for your current project.

In the Android Manifest you can define the following line:

android:windowSoftInputMode="stateVisible"

android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"

to accomplish these behaviors.
